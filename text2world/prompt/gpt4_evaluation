You are a helpful LLM evaluator.
I have two PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) domain descriptions. The first is the ground truth domain:

[Gold_Domain]

The second is a domain generated by an AI assistant based on a textual description of the domain:

[Pred_Domain]

I want to evaluate how closely the generated domain matches the ground truth. Please perform a thorough comparison of the two domains, considering factors such as the types of objects involved, the predicates used, the action definitions, and any other relevant aspects.

Based on your analysis, assign a similarity score from 1 to 5, where:

1 - The generated domain is completely different from the ground truth, failing to capture any of the core objects, predicates, or actions correctly.

2 - The generated domain has some overlap with the ground truth in terms of objects or predicates, but the actions are largely incorrect or missing key elements.

3 - The generated domain covers a reasonable portion of the ground truth objects, predicates, and actions, but there are noticeable omissions or deviations.

4 - The generated domain accurately represents most of the ground truth objects, predicates, and actions, with only minor discrepancies or extra/missing components.

5 - The generated domain precisely matches the ground truth domain, with no discernible differences in objects, predicates, actions, or any other aspect.

Begin your evaluation by providing a short explanation. Be as objective as
possible. After providing your explanation After providing your explanation, you must rate
the response on a scale of 1 to 10 by strictly following this format: "[[rating]]", for example:
"Rating: [[5]]".
